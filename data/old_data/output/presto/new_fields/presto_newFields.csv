"919,918,Fix handling of Hive bucketed tables,The bucketing code assumes that tables declared as being bucketed actually have the correct file layout in HDFS. `HiveSplitIterable` currently walks the directly structure as normal when bucketing is enabled and skips any files that don't match the bucket file. It should do this instead:
- Verify that the directory has exactly the right number of files
- Verify that the directory has no subdirectories
- If all checks pass, return splits for the bucket file
- Otherwise, ignore bucketing and return splits for all files as normal

The bucket file is determined by sorting the filenames lexicographically and returning the Nth file.,nan,0"
"1109,1044,Support write and retry in PrestoS3FileSystem,1. support writing to S3

 =||= Are you going to open a new pull request?
 =||= Whoops, I accidentally close it. Reopen now.
 =||= kindly ping
 =||= Does this support writing result tables to S3?
 =||= Yes. This supports ""Create Table As Select"" to create table in S3
 =||= Great, does it already support that for hdfs?  I didn't see that ability in the documentation
 =||= ""Create Table As Select"" should already be supported:

 =||= @zhenxiao, in order to avoid more back and forth on the review, I made some changes to your commit and created a new pull request #1109 with it, and added some additional commits with other fixes and unit tests. It would be great if you can review and try it out (will also have someone else on our end review it, maybe @dain). Sorry that I kept you waiting for so long on this.
 =||= @electrum Thanks. I will review and test it over the weekend.
